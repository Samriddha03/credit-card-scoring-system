# Credit Card Scoring System

## Project Overview
The **Credit Card Scoring System** is a machine learning application that predicts the credit risk of clients applying for a credit card. It helps financial institutions assess whether a client is likely to default based on personal and financial information.

The project features a **FastAPI backend**, which serves the ML model for real-time predictions. It is lightweight, production-ready, and can be deployed on **Railway** or other cloud platforms.
